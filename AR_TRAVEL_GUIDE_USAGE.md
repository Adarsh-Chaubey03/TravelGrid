1. Navigate to any destination page (e.g., `/location/1`)
2. Scroll to the action buttons section
3. Click either:
   - **Basic AR** - For a simplified AR experience
   - **Advanced AR** - For the full feature set with object recognition, translation, and spatial mapping

### Method 2: From Navigation Menu
1. Click the menu icon in the top right corner
2. Expand the "Tools" section
3. Click on "AR Travel Guide"
4. Select a location or use the demo

### Method 3: Direct URLs
- **AR Travel Guide Page**: `/ar-travel-guide`
- **AR Demo Page**: `/ar-demo`

## Using the AR Travel Guide

### Camera Permissions
When you first launch the AR Travel Guide, your browser will ask for permission to access your camera. Grant this permission to enable the AR experience.

### Geolocation Services
The AR Travel Guide uses your location to provide contextually relevant information. You may be prompted to allow location access.

### Basic AR Mode
- Displays your location information overlaid on the camera feed
- Shows nearby points of interest
- Provides basic navigation cues

### Advanced AR Mode
- **Object Recognition**: Identifies landmarks, buildings, and points of interest
- **Visual Translation**: Translates signs and text in real-time
- **Spatial Mapping**: Shows 3D point cloud data of your environment
- **Gesture Controls**: Tap to interact with AR objects

## Features Overview

### Object Recognition
Point your camera at landmarks, buildings, or points of interest to:
- See bounding boxes around detected objects
- Get information about what you're viewing
- View confidence levels for object detection

### Visual Translation
- Text in the camera view is automatically translated
- Original and translated text are displayed simultaneously
- Supports multiple languages (English, Spanish, French, German)

### Spatial Mapping
- 3D point cloud visualization of your environment
- Elevation and terrain data
- Spatial relationship indicators

### Gesture Controls
- Tap on AR objects to interact with them
- Close the AR view with the "Close AR" button

## Supported Devices

### Mobile Devices
- **iOS**: Safari 15+ or Chrome for iOS
- **Android**: Chrome 79+ or Firefox 71+

### Desktop Devices
- **Windows**: Chrome 79+, Firefox 71+, Edge 79+
- **macOS**: Safari 15+, Chrome 79+, Firefox 71+

### Requirements
- Camera access
- Geolocation services
- WebGL support
- Stable internet connection (for initial loading)

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working
1. Check browser permissions for camera access
2. Ensure no other applications are using the camera
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Verify your browser supports WebRTC

### Location Not Accurate
1. Ensure location services are enabled on your device
2. Check browser permissions for location access
3. Move to an area with better GPS reception
4. Enable high accuracy location in browser settings

### AR Overlays Not Visible
1. Ensure WebGL is enabled in your browser
2. Check that your device meets the minimum requirements
3. Verify that AR libraries loaded successfully
4. Try using a different browser

### Performance Issues
1. Close other applications to free up system resources
2. Ensure your device has sufficient battery
3. Move to an area with better lighting conditions
4. Reduce the number of browser tabs open

## Best Practices

### For Optimal Experience
- Use in well-lit environments
- Hold your device steady when scanning objects
- Move slowly to allow time for object recognition
- Keep your camera lens clean

### For Translation Features
- Ensure text is clearly visible in the camera view
- Position text perpendicular to the camera for best results
- Avoid glare or reflections on signs

### For Spatial Mapping
- Move your device slowly to build accurate point clouds
- Scan from multiple angles for complete spatial data
- Avoid rapid movements that may disrupt mapping

## Privacy & Security

### Data Handling
- All processing happens client-side
- No camera or location data is transmitted to servers
- User preferences are stored locally

### Permissions
- Camera access is only used for AR rendering
- Location data is used only for contextual information
- All permissions can be revoked through browser settings
