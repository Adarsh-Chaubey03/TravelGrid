TravelGrid Community Code of Conduct

Our goal: a friendly, inclusive, and respectful community for everyone â€” contributors, users, and maintainers.

1. Be respectful
- Treat others with kindness and respect.
- Assume good intent and ask clarifying questions instead of making assumptions.

2. Zero tolerance for harassment
- Harassment, hate speech, discrimination, or abusive language will not be tolerated.
- This includes comments based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or other personal traits.

3. Report violations
- If you experience or witness misconduct, open an issue or email the maintainers (provide screenshots or links when possible).
- Maintain confidentiality; avoid public callouts.

4. Community tone
- Be helpful and constructive in code reviews and discussions.
- Welcome newcomers, explain decisions, and point to resources when possible.

5. Enforcement
