# Multi-Modal Trip Planning System

## Overview

The Multi-Modal Trip Planning System is an advanced travel planning solution that integrates various transportation modes — flights, trains, buses, car rentals, and ride-sharing — into optimized itineraries. The system provides real-time pricing comparisons and dynamic cost optimization for travelers.

## Features

### 1. Multi-Modal Integration
- Integrates with multiple transportation APIs:
  - Airlines
  - Railways
  - Bus services
  - Car rental platforms
  - Ride-sharing services

### 2. Real-Time Pricing Comparison
- Dynamic pricing models that adjust based on demand fluctuations
- Real-time comparison engine for all transportation options
- Cost optimization suggestions

### 3. Environmental Impact Awareness
- Carbon footprint calculation for each transportation option
- Eco-friendly travel optimization suggestions
- Environmental impact visualization

### 4. Advanced Optimization
- Constraint satisfaction algorithms for optimal scheduling
- Multi-constraint optimization for cost, time, and environmental impact
- Intelligent route combinations

- `GET /api/multimodal/transport-options` - Get all transport options (admin)
- `PUT /api/multimodal/transport-options/:id` - Update transport option (admin)
- `DELETE /api/multimodal/transport-options/:id` - Delete transport option (admin)

## Implementation Details

### Transport Option Model

The `TransportOption` model standardizes all transportation modes with the following fields:

- `type` - Transport type (flight, train, bus, car-rental, ride-share)
- `provider` - Service provider name
- `name` - Specific service name
- `origin` and `destination` - Route information
- `departureTime` and `arrivalTime` - Schedule information
- `basePrice` and `dynamicPrice` - Pricing information
- `carbonFootprint` - Environmental impact
- `seatsAvailable` - Availability information
- `amenities` - Service amenities
- `stops` - Intermediate stops

### Dynamic Pricing Algorithm

The system calculates dynamic prices based on:

1. **Demand Factor** - Based on seat availability
2. **Time Factor** - Based on proximity to departure time
3. **Season Factor** - Based on travel season

### Carbon Footprint Calculation

Environmental impact is calculated based on:

1. **Distance Estimation** - Between origin and destination
2. **Transport Type** - Different modes have different carbon factors
3. **Efficiency Factor** - Based on vehicle technology

### Optimization Algorithm

The system optimizes itineraries based on user preferences:

1. **Cost Priority** - Lowest price options first
2. **Time Priority** - Shortest duration options first
3. **Eco Priority** - Lowest carbon footprint options first
4. **Balanced** - Combination of cost and time optimization

## Usage Examples

### 1. Searching Transport Options

Users can search for transport options between two locations on a specific date.

### 2. Creating Multi-City Itineraries

Users can plan complex multi-city trips with optimization across all segments.

### 3. Comparing Environmental Impact

Users can compare the carbon footprint of different transportation options.

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced API Integration
- Real-time integration with transportation provider APIs
- Automated data synchronization

### 2. Machine Learning Optimization
- Predictive pricing models
- Personalized recommendation engine

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- Interactive route mapping
- Mobile app integration
- Social sharing features

### 4. Additional Features
- Loyalty program integration
- Travel insurance options
- Real-time delay notifications

## Educational Value
